Comment: Upstream embeds some JavaScript dependencies into the source tree.
 Everything that is already packaged in Debian has been removed, and the
 rest was left embedded.

Comment: The header mentions a BSD-style license. I have sent PR to InfluxDB
 so that they include the license. See:

Comment: shared/admin/js/vendor/react-0.13.3.min.js was replaced by
 the original sources from https://fb.me/react-0.13.3.js and is
 minified at build time. Had to maintain the embedded version,
 as there is no Debian package.
